## General Info
 Calculator to computer two values in 4 primitive operation (addition, subtraction, multiply, division). The calc 
 can be made by set values on array(rightValue or leftValue) from main or input the string referent the operation, leftValue and rightValue
 on command line.
 Project contemplates just natural numbers (0-9) when use "interactive" commandline, the instruction in [Setup](#setup).
 
## Technologies
Project is created with:

* Java Openjdk-18

## Setup
To run the calculations is necessary to have java jdk install in folder location. Let's get it: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaelofil/Calculator-Engine.git
$ cd Calculator/src
$ javac Calculate.main 
$ java Calculate.main
```

With interactive mode in commandline:


```
$ cd src
$ java Calculate.main interactive
```

When enter interactive mode the follow message appear "Enter operation an operation and two numbers:", can type five operation:
* Add
* Subtraction
* Multiply
* Division
* When

<strong>when</strong> operation is used to plus days in determine date | format year-month-day | E.g: "when 2021-05-21 five"

The numbers can be write in full or simple way as 7.

<strong>Add five 8.6</strong>

## Status

Project is: finished, but if I have any inspiration I will add. 

## Final considerations

This reposotory was made with intuito to study java syntax.
